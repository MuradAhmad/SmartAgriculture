In this project our plan is to use a Ruuvitag sensors which can be implemented to the living environment of indoor plants. These Ruuvitag sensors are able to collect temperature and air humidity data from the area where they are placed and the app will then analyse this data from a specific period of time. The app will then be able to suggest suitable plants for the user to grow or to optimise the environment for the existing plants. When the environment temperature and air humidity is not suitable  for a particular plant, the app will send a notification to the user to change its position.
