In this Android mobile project, Ruuvitag sensors are implemented to the living environment of indoor plants. These Ruuvitag sensors are able to collect temperature and air humidity data from the area where they are placed. The app analyse Ruuvitag sensors data along with the luminous intensity from mobile sensor to suggest suitable environment for the plants. When the environment temperature, air humidity and light intensity are not suitable for a particular plant, the app sends a notification to the user to change the particular plant position.
