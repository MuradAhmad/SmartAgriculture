This android application is developed for home plants. Ruuvitag sensors are used to collect temperature and air humidity data. When the environmental temperature and air humidity is not suitable for a particular plant, the app sends a notification to the user to change plant position. The app is developed with basic features and it needs future work such as plant database for information.
